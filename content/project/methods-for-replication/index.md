As a replication crisis unfolds in science, it has become apparent that the best way to design and analyze replication studies remains an open question.
Part of the problem is that "replication" is a broad term that tends to mean different things to different people.
This work formalizes the study of replication as a statistical problem, including examining efficient methods for analyzing replication studies and approaches to designing them.
