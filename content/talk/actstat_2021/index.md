title: "Design and Analysis of Replication Studies: Considerations and Pitfalls"
event: "ACTStat 2021"

summary:
abstract: "
Though replication is central to the scientific method, applied statisticians are seldom asked their input on replication studies in translational science. This talk introduces to key considerations for designing and analyzing replication studies, and identifies the implications of ignoring those considerations. Among these implications are that some design and analysis methods for replication that have been used by prior research have fatal statistical flaws.
