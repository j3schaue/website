 abstract = {In this rejoinder, we discuss Mathur and VanderWeele’s response to our article, “Statistical Analyses for
Studying Replication: Meta-Analytic Perspectives,” which appears in this current issue. We attempt to
clarify a point of confusion regarding the inclusion of an original study in an analysis of replication, and
the potential impact of publication bias. We then discuss the methods used by Mathur and VanderWeele
to conduct an alternative analysis of the Gambler’s Fallacy example from our article. We highlight that
there are some potential statistical and conceptual differences to their approach compared to what we
propose in our article},
